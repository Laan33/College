(provide display_in_order)



;; A. Display in sorted order the contents of a binary search tree

;; Once the binary search tree has been created, its elements can be retrieved in-order by: 
  ;; ● Recursively traversing the left subtree of the root node.
  ;; ● Accessing the node itself
  ;; ● Then recursively traversing the right subtree of the node

(define display_in_order


)

;; B. Return #t or #f if a given item is present or absent in a tree or not. The function
;; should take the item and a list representing a tree.



;; C. Insert an item correctly into a list representing a binary search tree. Your function
;; should take an item and a tree as inputs.



;; D. Take a list of items and insert them into a binary search tree.


;; E. Implement a tree-sort algorithm. Your function should take a list of items and display
;; them in sorted order.


;; F. Implement a higher order version of the tree-sort function that takes a list and a
;; function that determines the sorted order. For example, write a version that sorts
;; the list in ascending, descending and ascending based on last digit.
