Sample output:
There are 3 expenses in the system totalling to a value of EUR 769.18.
Hint: create a static method in ExpensesPortal for summing the expenses. The method
should support expenses in two currencies (EUR and USD). The return type should be of type
joda.org.Money and should be in EUR, so youâ€™ll need to convert from USD to EUR to
support USD expenses. See the joda.org link above for examples of how to do this.
