Write a class with a main method (or include a main method in the Bank class) that does the
following:
• declares and instantiates a Bank object
• creates and adds three Account instances to the bank with different starting balances
• declares and instantiates two TransactionProcessor threads and one
RandomTransactionGenerator thread
• executes the threads using a thread pool (ExecutorService) and waits for them to
complete
• After 10 seconds, explicitly shuts down the RandomTransactionGenerator thread
• prints out the details of the accounts after the transactions have finished
