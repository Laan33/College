We learn about inheritance in this assignment. 
In this case, the bird and fish extend off of animal, 
where canary and ostrich extend off the former and trout and shark off the latter.

This stops a lot of duplication of code. 

We have a toString method in each class to print out all the data it stores. 
There's also an equals method to compare two classes to see if they are the same. 

The test class then just creates two objects which do the following;
Test1 - creates an array of the animal objects and then prints off their corresponding info.
Test2 - creates an array of various animals, some duplicates. 
It then uses the equals method in each class to compare them to other classes to find duplicates. 
It prints the location, name and class type to the screen then.
