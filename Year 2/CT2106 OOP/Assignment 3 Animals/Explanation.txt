This whole assignment was to get familiar with inheratince. 
In this case, the bird and fish class extend from animal.
Both the bird and fish each have their own two leafs that extend off them; trout, shark, canary, ostrich. 

All of these subclasses inherit methods and fields from the abstract classes above them. 
For example - the animal class has a method for getName, where any of the animals can call it as they inherit it. 

So even when it's called in ostrich, it still works even if the name is assigned and the method is in animal.

This is the same process for all the various fields / methods.
