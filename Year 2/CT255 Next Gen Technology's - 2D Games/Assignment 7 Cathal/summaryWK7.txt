Add game states 
    isGamePlaying etc 

If not running 
    two rectangles as 'buttons'

Modify the mousePressed method -> so that it checks for clicks on buttons regions
    -start -> switches to isGamePlay true
    -random -> randomises the game - method random

In playing state, apply rules of conways game of life at each repaint

Conway’s Life: Rules
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
•We will need to iterate through all game cells, counting the amount of live neighbours that each has, before applying the above rules

Make conwayLife checker method


we will need to have two separate game states in memory:
    –one is the ‘front buffer’ that we’re currently displaying, and which we are checking the above rules on
    –the other is the ‘back buffer’ that we’re applying the results of the rules to.
    –the ‘back’ is switched to ‘front’ after applying the rules to every cell
    private boolean gameState[][][] = new boolean[40][40][2];

if(!isGamePlaying) {
        JButton button = new JButton("click me");
        button.setBounds(50,100,100,50); /*Distance from left,           
                      Distance from top,length of button, height of button*/
        add(button);
        }
